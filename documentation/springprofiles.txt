- certain only active in development env. and other on production
- like different database
- can enable and disable the features.

1. set profile in the edit configuration in the application
like set dev environment.
2. - set spring.profiles.active=dev in the application.properties file to activate the dev profile.
   - can set multiple profile in the with comma separated. like spring.profiles.active=dev,test,custom
   - it firstly get all info from application.properties then dev override the application, after test override the
   dev. Lastly custom override the test properties value. Finally, get info from custom.properties if it exists (always
   get the last profile info). so order is important.

 3. set profile programmatically
    - var app = new SpringApplication(AliboudemoprojectApplication.class);
      		app.setDefaultProperties(Collections.singletonMap("spring.profiles.active","test"));
      		var ctx = app.run( args);

 4. Bean only available on specific profile
